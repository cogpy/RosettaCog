# OpenCog: Post-Polyglot Transcendent AI Evaluation Framework

## Overview

OpenCog is a meta-evaluation system that analyzes all programming languages and paradigms represented in the RosettaCog repository to determine the optimal implementation language for each AI/AGI functionality.

## Concept

Every programming language ever conceived is represented in RosettaCog through the specific functions that language was designed to express. OpenCog evaluates these implementations across multiple dimensions to create a "frankencog patchwork inference fabric" - an optimal combination of the best language-specific implementations for each cognitive function.

## Architecture

The OpenCog framework consists of several components:

1. **Language Capability Analyzer**: Evaluates the expressiveness and efficiency of each language for specific cognitive tasks
2. **AI Task Categorizer**: Classifies RosettaCode tasks into AI/cognitive computing categories
3. **Benchmarking Engine**: Measures performance, readability, and maintainability metrics
4. **Integration Manifest Generator**: Creates the "patchwork quilt" specification showing which language to use for each AI function

## AI/AGI Functional Categories

OpenCog categorizes tasks into the following AI domains:

- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Logic, theorem proving, constraint satisfaction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Search, matching, classification
- **Knowledge Representation**: Data structures, graphs, semantic networks
- **Machine Learning**: Statistical methods, optimization, neural networks
- **Natural Language Processing**: String manipulation, parsing, text analysis
- **Planning & Problem Solving**: Heuristic search, game playing, puzzle solving
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: Probabilistic methods, fuzzy logic
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Concurrent systems, distributed computing, agent systems

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze all languages and generate evaluation report
./opencog/bin/opencog-analyze

# Generate the frankencog integration manifest
./opencog/bin/opencog-manifest

# Evaluate a specific language
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-lang Python

# Evaluate a specific AI category
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-category "Symbolic Reasoning"
```

## Output

The framework generates:
- Language capability profiles
- AI task categorization maps
- Performance benchmarks
- The FrankenCog Integration Manifest (optimal language selection for each function)
- Transcendent expression reports

## Philosophy

OpenCog represents the culmination of evaluating every known programming language against the full spectrum of AI capabilities. Through systematic benchmarking and optimization, we identify the most effective implementation for each cognitive function, creating a post-polyglot synthesis where each language's unique strengths are leveraged for the specific functions it was conceived to express.
