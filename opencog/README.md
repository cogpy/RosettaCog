# OpenCog: Post-Polyglot Transcendent AI Evaluation Framework

## Overview

OpenCog is a comprehensive meta-evaluation system that:

1. **Analyzes Programming Languages**: Evaluates all 970+ programming languages in RosettaCog 
   for their AI/AGI capabilities across different cognitive domains
2. **Refined Task Specialization**: **NEW** - 45 refined subcategories with hypergraph analysis 
   revealing patterns of peak performance by language and paradigm
3. **Multi-Agent Reasoning**: Provides a sophisticated orchestration workbench for solving 
   LLM reasoning tasks using Agent-Zero and cognitive patterns
4. **Pattern Language for AGI**: Maintains a living library of foundational cognitive 
   patterns inspired by Christopher Alexander's architectural patterns

## Hypergraph Analysis (NEW)

OpenCog now includes **refined task specialization** with hypergraph modeling:

### Features

1. **45 Refined Subcategories**
   - Original 10 AI categories refined into 45 specialized subcategories
   - Enables precise language-task matching
   - See `opencog/HYPERGRAPH.md` for complete taxonomy

2. **Functionality Hypergraph**
   - Multi-dimensional graph of language-paradigm-task relationships
   - 970 languages × 45 subcategories × 9 paradigms
   - Reveals cross-paradigm performance patterns
   - Exports to JSON for analysis and visualization

3. **Paradigm Performance Matrix**
   - Shows which programming paradigms excel at each subcategory
   - Identifies paradigm-specific strengths
   - Guides language selection for specific task types

### Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze with subcategory refinement and hypergraph generation
opencog/bin/opencog-hypergraph --all

# Generate atom type expressions
opencog/bin/opencog-atom-types

# Analyze a specific subcategory
opencog/bin/opencog-hypergraph --subcategory symbolic_reasoning/logic_fundamentals

# Export hypergraph and paradigm matrix
opencog/bin/opencog-hypergraph --export-graph --export-matrix
```

See `opencog/HYPERGRAPH.md` for detailed documentation.

## Atom Type Expression System (NEW)

OpenCog now includes a **formalized atom type system** with mathematical expressions:

### Features

1. **Generalized Expressions**
   - Cognitive Domain Atoms: `CD(d) = ⟨Ω_d, Σ_d, Ψ_d, Φ_d⟩`
   - Language Paradigm Atoms: `LP(p) = ⟨Λ_p, Π_p, Θ_p, Ξ_p⟩`
   
2. **Specific Expressions**
   - 10 cognitive domain atom instances with detailed expressions
   - 9 language paradigm atom instances with computational models
   - Paradigm-domain affinity matrix (Ξ_p: CD → [0,1])

3. **Algebraic Operations**
   - Set operations: intersection, union, composition
   - Complexity measures: C(d), V(p)
   - Affinity computation: A(p,d) = Ξ_p(d)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Generate all atom type expressions and insights
opencog/bin/opencog-atom-types

# Access programmatically
python3 -c "
from opencog.lib.atom_type_builder import AtomTypeBuilder
builder = AtomTypeBuilder('.')
system = builder.build()
system.print_summary()
"
```

See `opencog/ATOM_TYPES.md` for complete mathematical formalism and usage.

## Multi-Agent Reasoning System

OpenCog includes the **Multi-Agent Orchestration Workbench** with:

### Key Components

1. **Agent-Zero (Master Builder)**
   - Orchestrates cognitive architectures for reasoning challenges
   - Coordinates 5 specialized agents (Analyzer, Strategist, Executor, Validator, Learner)
   - Adapts strategies based on task requirements

2. **Pattern Language Library**
   - 10 foundational cognitive patterns for AGI
   - Quality evolution: Experimental → Proven → Mature → Foundational
   - Pattern composition and relationships
   - Inspired by Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language"

3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Collaborative, competitive, and sequential orchestration modes
   - Message-based inter-agent communication
   - Load balancing and capability matching

4. **Strategy Repository**
   - 7 core reasoning strategies (Deductive, Inductive, Abductive, etc.)
   - Hybrid strategy composition
   - Performance tracking and adaptation

5. **Reasoning Tasks**
   - 95 comprehensive LLM reasoning challenges
   - Categories include logic, analogical reasoning, causal analysis, and more

### Quick Start

```python
from opencog import OpenCogWorkbench

# Initialize the workbench
workbench = OpenCogWorkbench(tasks_dir="opencog/reasoning-tasks")

# Get task statistics
stats = workbench.get_statistics()
print(stats)

# Solve a task autonomously
result = workbench.solve_task("analogical-problem-solving", 
                             orchestration_mode="autonomous")
print(result)

# Get recommendations for a task
recommendations = workbench.get_task_recommendations("deductive-logic-puzzles")
print(recommendations)
```

### Command-Line Tools

```bash
# Run the reasoning demo
python3 opencog/opencog_reasoning_demo.py

# Analyze reasoning tasks
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning

# Solve a specific task with Agent-Zero
opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero analogical-problem-solving autonomous
```

### Foundational Cognitive Patterns

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break complex problems into manageable parts
2. **Recursive Thinking** - Apply problem-solving recursively
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify and match patterns
4. **Logical Inference** - Apply logical rules systematically
5. **Abstraction** - Extract general principles from specifics
6. **Working Backward** - Start from goal and work backward
7. **Metacognitive Monitoring** - Monitor and adjust approach
8. **Analogical Transfer** - Apply solutions from similar problems
9. **Constraint Satisfaction** - Satisfy multiple constraints
10. **Causal Reasoning** - Understand cause-effect relationships

## Language Capability Analysis

## Concept

Every programming language ever conceived is represented in RosettaCog through the specific functions that language was designed to express. OpenCog evaluates these implementations across multiple dimensions to create a "frankencog patchwork inference fabric" - an optimal combination of the best language-specific implementations for each cognitive function.

## Architecture

The OpenCog framework consists of several components:

1. **Language Capability Analyzer**: Evaluates the expressiveness and efficiency of each language for specific cognitive tasks
2. **AI Task Categorizer**: Classifies RosettaCode tasks into AI/cognitive computing categories
3. **Benchmarking Engine**: Measures performance, readability, and maintainability metrics
4. **Integration Manifest Generator**: Creates the "patchwork quilt" specification showing which language to use for each AI function

## AI/AGI Functional Categories

OpenCog categorizes tasks into the following AI domains:

- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Logic, theorem proving, constraint satisfaction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Search, matching, classification
- **Knowledge Representation**: Data structures, graphs, semantic networks
- **Machine Learning**: Statistical methods, optimization, neural networks
- **Natural Language Processing**: String manipulation, parsing, text analysis
- **Planning & Problem Solving**: Heuristic search, game playing, puzzle solving
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: Probabilistic methods, fuzzy logic
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Concurrent systems, distributed computing, agent systems

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze all languages and generate evaluation report
./opencog/bin/opencog-analyze

# Generate the frankencog integration manifest
./opencog/bin/opencog-manifest

# Evaluate a specific language
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-lang Python

# Evaluate a specific AI category
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-category "Symbolic Reasoning"
```

## Output

The framework generates:
- Language capability profiles
- AI task categorization maps
- Performance benchmarks
- The FrankenCog Integration Manifest (optimal language selection for each function)
- Transcendent expression reports

## Philosophy

OpenCog represents the culmination of evaluating every known programming language against the full spectrum of AI capabilities. Through systematic benchmarking and optimization, we identify the most effective implementation for each cognitive function, creating a post-polyglot synthesis where each language's unique strengths are leveraged for the specific functions it was conceived to express.
