# OpenCog-Reasoning-Tasks Integration - Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the OpenCog Multi-Agent Orchestration Workbench from the [OpenCog-Reasoning-Tasks](https://github.com/cogpy/OpenCog-Reasoning-Tasks) repository into RosettaCog, creating a comprehensive framework that combines:

1. **Language AI Capability Analysis** (existing) - Evaluates 970+ programming languages for AI/AGI tasks
2. **Multi-Agent Reasoning System** (new) - Orchestrates sophisticated reasoning with Agent-Zero and cognitive patterns

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Core Components (5 Python modules)

```
opencog/
â”œâ”€â”€ workbench.py              # Main OpenCogWorkbench interface
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/agent_zero.py      # Agent-Zero master builder with 5 specialized agents
â”œâ”€â”€ patterns/pattern_library.py    # 10 foundational cognitive patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ orchestration/multi_agent.py   # Multi-agent coordination system
â””â”€â”€ strategies/strategy_system.py  # 7 core reasoning strategies
```

### 2. Reasoning Tasks (95 tasks)

All 95 reasoning tasks copied to `opencog/reasoning-tasks/`:
- Analogical reasoning tasks
- Deductive logic puzzles
- Ethical dilemma resolution
- Theory of mind challenges
- Causal reasoning tasks
- Pattern recognition tasks
- And many more...

### 3. Command-Line Tools (2 new tools)

```bash
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning        # Analyze reasoning tasks
opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero       # Orchestrate tasks with Agent-Zero
```

### 4. Documentation (3 files updated/created)

- `ReadMe.md` - Updated with OpenCog multi-agent features
- `opencog/README.md` - Updated with complete system overview
- `opencog/OPENCOG_REASONING.md` - Comprehensive usage guide (13KB)

### 5. Demo Script

- `opencog/opencog_reasoning_demo.py` - 6 interactive demonstrations

## Key Features

### Agent-Zero Master Builder

- **5 Specialized Agents**:
  - Analyzer: Task decomposition, requirement analysis, pattern matching
  - Strategist: Strategy design, cognitive pattern selection, optimization
  - Executor: Reasoning, problem solving, computation
  - Validator: Solution validation, correctness checking, quality assessment
  - Learner: Pattern learning, performance analysis, adaptation

### Pattern Language Library

**10 Foundational Cognitive Patterns** inspired by Christopher Alexander:
1. Problem Decomposition
2. Recursive Thinking
3. Pattern Recognition and Matching
4. Logical Inference
5. Abstraction and Generalization
6. Working Backward from Goal
7. Metacognitive Monitoring
8. Analogical Transfer
9. Constraint Satisfaction
10. Causal Reasoning

Each pattern includes context, problem, forces, solution, examples, and quality tracking.

### Strategy Repository

**7 Core Reasoning Strategies**:
1. Decomposition Strategy (Systematic)
2. Pattern Matching Strategy (Analogical)
3. Constraint Propagation Strategy (Systematic)
4. Working Backward Strategy (Heuristic)
5. Hypothesis Testing Strategy (Abductive)
6. Recursive Refinement Strategy (Systematic)
7. Creative Exploration Strategy (Creative)

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

**3 Orchestration Modes**:
- **Autonomous**: Agent-Zero fully controls the process
- **Collaborative**: Multiple agents work together
- **Guided**: Provides recommendations for user guidance

## Usage Examples

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Run the demo
python3 opencog/opencog_reasoning_demo.py

# Analyze reasoning tasks
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning

# Get task recommendations
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning analogical-problem-solving

# Solve a task with Agent-Zero
opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero deductive-logic-puzzles autonomous
```

### Python API

```python
from opencog import OpenCogWorkbench

# Initialize
workbench = OpenCogWorkbench(tasks_dir="opencog/reasoning-tasks")

# Get statistics
stats = workbench.get_statistics()
print(f"Tasks: {stats['tasks']['total']}")
print(f"Patterns: {stats['patterns']['total']}")
print(f"Strategies: {stats['strategies']['total']}")

# Get recommendations
recs = workbench.get_task_recommendations("analogical-problem-solving")

# Solve a task
result = workbench.solve_task(
    "deductive-logic-puzzles",
    orchestration_mode="collaborative"
)
```

## Verification Results

All integration tests pass successfully:

âœ… **Test 1**: Original OpenCog language analysis - PASS  
âœ… **Test 2**: Reasoning task analysis - PASS  
âœ… **Test 3**: Task recommendations - PASS  
âœ… **Test 4**: Agent-Zero orchestration - PASS  
âœ… **Test 5**: Python API integration - PASS  

### System Statistics

- ðŸ“Š **970 programming languages** analyzed for AI capabilities
- ðŸ§  **94 reasoning tasks** loaded and categorized
- ðŸ¤– **5 specialized agents** with distinct roles
- ðŸ”„ **10 cognitive patterns** (all foundational quality)
- ðŸ“‹ **7 reasoning strategies** across 5 types
- ðŸŽ¯ **3 orchestration modes** for different needs

## Architecture

The integration maintains clean separation between:

1. **Language Evaluation** (existing):
   - `opencog/lib/opencog_analyzer.py` - Language capability analysis
   - `opencog/bin/opencog-analyze` - Language analysis CLI
   - `opencog/bin/opencog-manifest` - FrankenCog manifest generation

2. **Reasoning System** (new):
   - `opencog/workbench.py` - Multi-agent workbench
   - `opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning` - Reasoning analysis CLI
   - `opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero` - Task orchestration CLI

Both systems can work independently or together for comprehensive AI evaluation.

## Integration Benefits

1. **Complementary Systems**: Language analysis identifies which languages excel at specific AI tasks; reasoning system provides concrete challenges to test those capabilities

2. **FrankenCog Enhancement**: Can now evaluate reasoning capabilities across languages using the task collection

3. **Pattern Library**: Captures reusable cognitive strategies that can be implemented in different languages

4. **Agent-Zero**: Orchestrates optimal approaches that might combine multiple language paradigms

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 970 languages Ã— 94 reasoning tasks = potential for deep AI capability analysis
